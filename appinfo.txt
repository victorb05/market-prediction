This repository contains a trading bot script.

HOW TO ACCESS:
1. Download the code to your local PC
2. Change the code so that the variable for the API's coincide with your personal API Keys from Binance
3. Run the code

TIPS:
1. You can probably run this once every 8 hours: 12AM UTC, 8AM UTC, 4PM UTC
2. Let the code run 10 minutes before these times for the setup
3. Let the code run at least 1 hour after these times to complete the script

DESCRIPTION:
This trading strategy relies on overbought cryptocurrencies with a high funding.
Those coins usually experience a huge drop in price when funding is paid.
We try to trade this drop and make more profits than what we paid in funding.
The trading bot runs on Binance and Bybit APIs.
